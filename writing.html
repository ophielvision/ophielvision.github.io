      <h2>The Receiver Operates Automatically</h2>
      <p>The receiver operates automatically.<br />
      The current flows only while motion is taking place.<br />
      When a new queen takes control,<br />
      the old queen and thousands of workers<br />
      desert the hive to establish a new home.
      </p>

      <p>
      The eye is like a camera.<br />
      It is first filtered through rocks.
      </p>

      <p>
      The lens throws an inverted image.<br />
      The entire cast assembled.<br />
      With railroads radiating in every direction,<br />
      The scissors kick.<br />
      See her body swell as she sucks the blood of her victim.
      </p>

      <h2>This is What Happened to David's Bones</h2>

      <p>
      This is what happened to David’s bones.<br />
      With eyes opened through study,<br />
      Jim sees a way to improve a machine and simplify a process.<br />
      How to restore respiration when breathing has ceased.
      </p>

      <p>
      This is the kind of place where the fly will lay her eggs.<br />
      The dark ‘spots’ we sometimes see are holes.<br />
      This one is big enough to hold the Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
      When the direction of the current is reversed,<br />
      the direction of the lines of force is also reversed.<br />
      At twelve days, the life blood begins to circulate.<br />
      Boy scouts from another land show us some new stunts.

      <h2>This is How we Swim Through Water</h2>

      <p>
      Hatching through the egg case.<br />
      Learning body balance; submerge face,<br />
      float relaxed. The air's weight<br />
      makes possible the parachute.
      </p>

      <p>
      This is how we swim through water,<br />
      the dark place<br />
      in the center of the crater.<br />
      The swan dive. The electric torch a diver<br />
      uses. The star reporter<br />
      on special assignment.<br />
      In some such way a bird flies.<br />
      Note how they rise<br />
      and how they light.<br />
      Every year the group grows smaller.
      </p>

      <p>
      A sending station. A kite<br />
      floats in the air by being pulled<br />
      against the wind, testing the eyes<br />
      To see better what the Moon looks like,<br />
      To choose for every need and appetite.
      </p>

      <p>
      What do you see<br />
      out of your window at night?<br />
      A rudder to steer to left<br />
      or right.
